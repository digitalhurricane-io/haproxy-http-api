Uses the hug and haproxyadmin libraries to expose a few endpoints for the haproxy config and stats api. 

It generates a self signed ssl cert and uses basic auth. Username/Pass are constants set at the top of the haproxy_api.py file.
Default is admin:admin

I only put in the endpoints that I need for now. Feel free to add more and submit a pull request. 

In the following command, make sure "/var/run" is set to the directory where the haproxy socket exists as defined in your haproxy config file.

To build and run with docker:

docker build -t haproxy_http_api_image . && \
docker run -d -v /var/run:/socket_dir \
-p 2343:2343 \
--restart unless-stopped \
--name haproxy_http_api \
haproxy_http_api_image
